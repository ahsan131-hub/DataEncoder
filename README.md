# DataEncoder
### Final project of Data Structure and Algorithm (sukkur IBA University).

----Instructions for execution of the project-------

1. Extract the zip file and import the folder in an IDE.
2. Import the jfoenix.jar file provided in the zip folder of the project.
3. Also import the javafx sdk (also provided in the zip file).
4. Go to the "project configuration" -> "VM options" and besides the --module-path replace this 
   "C:\Users\SILENCE\Documents\javafx-sdk-15.0.1\lib" with the path of javafx sdk lib directory 
    on your system.
5. Go to the project "src" folder, open the "huffmanEncoder" directory, run the main method of 
   "main.java" file
6. You will see an interface before you, with three options. Browse file, encode, and decode 
   it (only .txt).
7. In order to encode a file, browse a text file from your system and the software will encode 
   it using Huffman algorithm, and create a directory with the name of "encoded files", and you 
   will have your encoded file there.
8. For decoding a file, browse an already encoded file, and the software will decode the file 
   and save the decoded file inside a directory "decoded files".
